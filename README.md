#Employee Attrition and Classification 

Welcome to the Employee Attrition and Classification repository! This project aims to analyze employee data to understand factors contributing to attrition and build classification models to predict employee attrition.

About
This repository contains scripts and notebooks for analyzing employee data to identify patterns and factors contributing to attrition. It also includes machine learning models for predicting employee attrition based on various features.

Features
Data Exploration: Explore employee data to understand the distribution of features and identify potential trends.
Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features and preprocess the data for model training.
Model Building: Build classification models using machine learning algorithms to predict employee attrition.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Usage
To get started with this project:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
Run the provided scripts or notebooks to explore the data, preprocess it, build and evaluate classification models.
Data
The data used in this analysis is provided in the data directory. It includes employee data with features such as age, education, job role, etc., along with the target variable indicating attrition.
